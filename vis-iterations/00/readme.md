Graph Example 5 for [How to Create Effective Network Data Visualization](http://elijahmeeks/networkviz/)

In this example, the position of the modularity nodes on the mini-map is determined by the average position of the nodes that make them up. Mousing over a node on the mini-map will highlight the node in the main network data visualization.

Drag the regular nodes to watch the change in position of the modularity nodes in the mini-map.

This example relies on the [jLouvain](https://github.com/upphiminn/jLouvain) library to calculate community structure.
